Hands-on practice with cloud computing and infrastructure:  
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** manage access with roles  
- **NSGs (Network Security Groups):** secure inbound/outbound traffic  
- **ARM Templates:** deploy infrastructure as code  
- **Load Balancer:** distribute traffic across virtual machines

  
## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- **Windows PowerShell** â€“ Automation  
- **Microsoft Azure** â€“ RBAC, NSG, ARM Templates, Load Balancer  
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ Version control
